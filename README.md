### What is this?
This is a simple MicroG installer. It can install MicroG and othe stuff into your system partition or as a Magisk module. It supports virtually all mobile architectures (arm/64, x86/64, mips/64) and fully supports KitKat and above. It can also (mostly) support much older versions, but sync adapters and some location providers won't work. It can even uninstall itself from your device, just rename it and flash it again.

The things included in the Standard Edition zip are:
 - MicroG (GMSCore, GSFProxy, Maps APIv1) (from MicroG FDroid repo)
 - Google Play store (modded for IAPs by Setialpha)
 - UNLP backends (Dejá vu, LocalWiFi, Mozilla, Nominatim) (From FDroid repo)
 - UNLP LocalGSM backend (From @ploink 's fork)
 - AuroraDroid (From Whyorean's GitLab)
 - AuroraServices (From Whyorean's GitLab)
 - Swype libs for AOSP keyboard (From OpenGApps GitHub repo)
 - Some Google DRM jars (From OpenGApps GitHub repo)
 - Google Sync adapters for KK to Q (From OpenGApps GitHub repo)
 - Permission files for all of this
 - An addon.d file to backup/restore everything on a rom flash

The things included in the NoGoolag Edition zip are:
 - MicroG (GMSCore, GSFProxy, Maps APIv1) (from MicroG FDroid repo)
 - FakeStore (from MicroG FDroid repo)
 - UNLP backends (Dejá vu, LocalWiFi, Mozilla, Nominatim) (From FDroid repo)
 - UNLP LocalGSM backend (From @ploink 's fork)
 - AuroraStore (From Whyorean's GitLab)
 - AuroraDroid (From Whyorean's GitLab)
 - AuroraServices (From Whyorean's GitLab)
 - Permission files for all of this
 - An addon.d file to backup/restore everything on a rom flash

The things included in the UNLP Edition zip are:
 - UNLP (From FDroid repo)
 - Maps APIv1
 - UNLP backends (Dejá vu, LocalWiFi, Mozilla, Nominatim) (From FDroid repo)
 - UNLP LocalGSM backend (From @ploink 's fork)
 - Permission files for all of this

### Notes
Dirty flashing not recommended. you'll mess up all your permissions and may even cause conflicts in app data, leading to crashes.
The maker does not support or endorse dirty flashing. It will harm you and your loved ones. Don't come complaining to me.

How to control the zip by changing its name:
NOTE: Control by name is not possible in Magisk Manager, since it copies the zip to a cache directory and renames it install.zip. This is unavoidable behaviour.

 - Add 'system' to its filename to force it to install/uninstall from system. Otherwise, it looks for Magisk, and if not found, installs to system. Obviously, if you flash it through Magisk Manager, you want to install it to Magisk. If not, you have to flash it through recovery.

 - Add 'uninstall' to its filename to uninstall it from your device, whether in Magisk mode or system mode. If you use Magisk Manager, your preffered method of uninstallation is from there.

Just rename it and flash it again for the intended effect.

For example, MinMicroG-Standard-2.7-beta3-milkandbootloops-20200428133205-signed.zip to system-MinMicroG-Standard-2.7-beta3-milkandbootloops-20200428133205-signed.zip (same for uninstall)

The zip debloats three specific Google apps from your phone (GmsCore, GoogleServicesFramework, Phonesky and their MicroG counterparts) and 4 NLP providers when the pack contents conflicts with them. In Magisk mode, they won't be removed from system, and if you uninstall the pack, they'll come back. If you install in system, the debloated stuff will be stored in internal-storage/MinMicroG/Backup.
WARNING: This zip does not and never will debloat anything else because that is the minimum coming in MicroG's way. I have had my own share of PTSD with debloating. I believe (through instinct) that it should work even on flashes over GApped ROMs, but don't take my word for it. Debloat before you flash.

If play store does not get signature spoofing permission for some reason. Type these commands in a terminal app (like Termux) :
su
```
pm grant com.android.vending android.permission.FAKE_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE
```

Remember that choosing magisk mode (which is default if magisk is installed already) will remove the minmicrog package if you uninstall magisk.

For support with flashing:
If you flashed through recovery, provide its logs.
If you used Magisk Manager, provide its logs.

### How do I build these packs myself?
cd to this directory and run:
```
> ./update.sh
```
To download all the assets to resdl directory.

NOTE: This will download a zipsigner.jar (topjohnwu's rewrite of the AOSP version) into resdl/util, if the file does not exist already. The source can be found in the Magisk repo, and prebuilt binaries in attachments [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=56621542)
```
> ./build.sh all
```
To build all the packs and place them in the releases directory.

That's it! If it tells you that some dependency is missing, install it.

You can pass update.sh several perl-style regexes as arguments to only download specific files.
You can pass build.sh a specific pack's conf name instead of all to build only the specific pack.

To build your own custom pack, refer to custom-pack.md in the conf directory.

### Credits
 - Thanks to @osm0sis for the base magisk/recovery code and inspiration and guidance on the majority of the stuff in here.
 - Thanks to @Setialpha, the creator of NanoDroid, and ale5000 for the lib installation code, permissions code, and patched play.
 - Thanks to FDroid and the MicroG project for actively resisting monopoly and control so we can actually use our devices without fear.
 - Thanks to Whyorean for his amazing works in the form of the Aurora Apps.
 - Thanks to my friends over at NoGoolag for their help and patience over however long it took me to learn to do shit without "rm -rf /"-ing devices.

And most of all, thank you Google & gang for being so shitty to people and thus giving us a mission.
